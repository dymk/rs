/**
 * Helper class for reading and writing a debug capture log. A debug capture log
 * has all the information that a shk-trace server process receives from Kdebug,
 * along with all the tracing requests that it received at the time. With such
 * a log it is possible to replay whatever a shk-trace server process has done,
 * without having to use Kdebug and trigger the same system behavior again. This
 * can be useful to debug bugs that only occur occasionally and to make it
 * possible to attach shk-trace to a normal debugger.
 *
 * Because this is intended for debugging, it does not have careful error
 * handling, it just aborts if things go wrong when writing.
