   * The directories that Shuriken has created to make room for outputs of build
   * steps. They are kept track of to be able to remove then when cleaning up.
   *
   * In addition to directories that are created by Shuriken explicitly to make
   * place for build targets, this also contains directories that have been
   * created by build steps. This might seem surprising at first. The rationale
   * is this:
   *
   * Shuriken treats directories similarly to how git does it: Shuriken is all
   * about files. Directories are just there to contain the files, and are not
   * part of the build product. They exist or don't exist rather arbitrarily,
   * but if they have files, they must exist. If a build depends on a directory
   * existing, a workaround is to create a dummy empty file in it.
   *
   * The reason for this design is that unlike files, which can be cleaned up
   * without deleting other build outputs, directories can't just be removed
   * without potentially removing other things as well. This assymetry makes it
   * pretty hard to allow directories to be treated as build step outputs.
   *
   * The key is a FileId, which is used for efficient lookup when cleaning. The
   * value is a Path, useful to know the actual path of the directory.
   *
   * The fact that the key is a FileId means that the directory must actually
   * exist to be able to be here. This is okay because if the directory has been
   * removed since it was last created by the build, it is ok (and actually
   * desired) for Shuriken to not track it anymore.
