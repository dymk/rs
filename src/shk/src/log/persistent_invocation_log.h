/**
 * This file provides functions for reading and manipulating the on-disk
 * representation of the invocation log. The purpose of the invocation log is
 * to keep track of commands that have been run before, to be able to calculate
 * if a command needs to be re-run or not, and to be able to clean up output
 * files when necessary.
 *
 * The invocation log of Shuriken is similar to a combination of the deps log
 * and the build log of Ninja. Like Ninja's build log, it contains an entry for
 * every command that Shuriken has run. Like the deps log, it contains
 * information about dependencies that were gathered during previous builds.
 *
 * In Shuriken it does not make sense to keep those logs separate, because
 * unlike Ninja, Shuriken tracks dependencies of every build step. Ninja only
 * uses the deps log for rules that have a depsfile.
 *
 * The format of the invocation log is similar to that of Ninja's deps log, but
 * it is slightly more compilcated because Shuriken also tracks directories that
 * it has created.
 *
 * Like Ninja's deps log, the invocation log has to support the following use
 * cases:
 *
 * 1. It needs to support writing to in a streaming way, as commands are being
 *    run. This is important to support interrupted builds.
 * 2. It needs to be read all at once on startup.
 *
 * The invocation log is a single binary file. Its contents are dependent on the
 * endianness of the machine, so invocation log files are not always portable
 * between machines. It contains a version header followed by a series of
 * entries. An entry consists of a uint32_t of the entry size (excluding the
 * header) where the two least significant bits signify the entry type followed
 * by entry type specific contents.
 *
 * Each entry is implicitly assigned an identifier, depending on its type. The
 * first Fingerprint entry has id 0, the first Path entry has id 1, the second
 * Fingerprint entry has id 1 and so on. The types with separate identifier
 * sequences are Path and Fingerprint. The other entry types are not referred to
 * by id.
 *
 * There are four types of entries:
 *
 * 0. Path: The contents is a single null-terminated string with a path,
 *    possibly with extra trailing \0s to ensure 4 byte alignment.
 * 1. Created directory or Fingerprint: If the size is 4 bytes, the contents is
 *    a single uint32_t entry id reference to a path of the created directory.
 *    Otherwise, this entry contains a uint32_t entry id reference to a path of
 *    a fingerprinted file followed by a Fingerprint object for that path (with
 *    no relation to directories).
 * 2. Invocation: An Invocation entry is an on-disk representation of an
 *    Invocations::Entry object.
 *     * It starts with a Hash object,
 *     * then contains a uint32_t with the number of ignored dependencies,
 *       followed by that many uint32_t, one for each ignored dependency,
 *     * then contains a uint32_t with the number of additional dependencies,
 *       followed by that many Hash objects, one for each additional dependency,
 *     * then contains a single uint32_t with the number of output files,
 *     * followed by a number of uint32_t fingerprint entry ids. The first
 *       fingerprint ids are outputs, the rest are inputs.
 * 3. Deleted entry: If the size is 4 bytes, the contents is a single uint32_t
 *    path id reference to a directory that has been deleted. If the size is
 *    sizeof(Hash), it contains a hash of an Invocations::Entry that has been
 *    deleted. When seeing a deleted entry, Shuriken acts as if the deleted
 *    entry does not exist in the log.
 *
 * Whenever an entry refers to another entry by id, the entry referred to must
 * have a lower id than the entry that refers to it.
 *
 * The invocation log is designed to be used by only one process at a time. The
 * processing functions here assume that the user of these functions has somehow
 * acquired exclusive access to the invocation log file.
