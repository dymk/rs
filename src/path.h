/**
 * Shuriken manifests contain lots of paths. In order to accurately track
 * dependencies between build steps, it is necessary to accurately detect when
 * two paths contained in the manifest point to the same underlying file. Doing
 * this in an efficient way is a little bit tricky. Solving that problem is the
 * job of this class.
 *
 * One part of the problem is that it is necessary to be able to compare two
 * paths efficiently. This is solved by providing a special Path class instead
 * of using plain strings. Path objects are interned, meaning that instead of
 * containing the path directly, it has a pointer to an object with the path.
 * Paths guarantees that these objects are unique, so to compare a path it is
 * sufficient to compare the pointer in the Path object.
 *
 * The other half of the problem is that it is necessary to ensure that there
 * can actually only exist one CanonicalizedPath (the type that Path objects
 * have a pointer to) objects are really unique for any given file. There are
 * several aspects to this:
 *
 * Links (symbolic and hard): If there is a symbolic link from a to b, the paths
 * a/c.txt and b/c.txt point to the same file. Doing this right requires
 * consulting the file system. What Paths does here is to stat all paths and
 * record the st_ino and st_dev fields of the stat result. If st_ino and st_dev
 * are the same, then the paths are known to point to the same file, even if
 * links are playing tricks with us.
 *
 * Using st_ino and st_dev alone is not sufficient, though, because the manifest
 * often (always in the case of a clean build) contains paths to files that do
 * not yet exist. When Paths encounters a path that does not exist, it gets the
 * dirname of the path and tries to stat that, over and over again until it
 * finds an existing path. It then stores the st_ino and st_dev fields along
 * with the path after it. This is what a CanonicalizedPath object contains.
 *
 * Other aspects that must be taken into consideration when checking if two
 * paths point to the same file are absolute vs relative paths, path
 * canonicalization and case folding.
 *
 * Absolute vs relative paths: If the current working directory is /a, then the
 * paths b.txt and /a/b.txt point to the same file. Like symbolic links, solving
 * this problem requires system calls (at the very least to find the current
 * working directory). One way to solve it could be to absolutize all relative
 * paths by prepending the working directory. Shuriken does not do this though,
 * because the solution mentioned above to deal with links solves this issue
 * too.
 *
 * Path canonicalization: The path a/../c.txt and the path c.txt actually point
 * to the same file. A tempting solution for this problem is to simply
 * canonicalize all paths as a string manipulation operation. However, in the
 * presence of symbolic links, canonicalization is not correct.
 *
 * Consider the following directory structure:
 *
 * /
 * ├── 1
 * │   └── 2
 * │       ├── 3
 * │       └── x.txt
 * └── a
 *     ├── x.txt
 *     └── symlink -> ../1/2/3
 *
 * In this situation, /a/symlink/../x.txt refers to /1/2/x.txt, but if it would
 * be canonicalized first, it would point to /a/x.txt.
 *
 * To avoid this problem, Paths only canonicalizes the part of the path that
 * does not exist. Later on, when building, Shuriken decides what directories it
 * will have to create in advance. Later, when it actually creates them, it
 * fails the build if some build step has already created the directory.
 * Otherwise, there is a chance that the created directory is a link, which
 * would violate assumptions that have been made. It could for example allow for
 * an undeclared dependency between two build steps.
 *
 * Case folding: On some systems (such as most Mac OS X and Windows systems),
 * the path A.txt and a.txt point to the same file. Part of this problem is
 * solved by the (st_ino, st_dev) solution mentioned above. The part that is not
 * fixed is the part of the path that does not yet exist. For this, Shuriken
 * normalizes and case folds the path.
 *
 * On systems that have case sensitive file systems, this could cause extraenous
 * dependencies between targets, when there are different output files that have
 * the same path when case folding. To avoid this, Paths disallows creating Path
 * objects that are different but the same when case folded. This is
 * conservative but that is arguably a nice thing: It makes sure that the build
 * does not break when run on systems with different case sensitivity settings.
