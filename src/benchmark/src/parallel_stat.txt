Results on 2,3 GHz Intel Core i7 mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina:

Conclusions:
* lstat seems to be the same as stat in performance (as expected)
* Up to ~100k files the results are rather predictable. With as many threads as virtual cores there is a ~4x speedup
* At 150k files the results vary quite a lot
* At 200k files single-threaded performance is about the same as multithreaded. I guess the file cache has maxed out at this point.

@200k files, peak performance is 5 threads @10% faster
@150k files, peak performance varies a lot, but around 7? @~3.5x faster
@100k files, peak performance is 15 threads @5x faster
@50k files,  peak performance is 7 threads @4x faster
@20k files,  peak performance is 7 threads @6x faster
