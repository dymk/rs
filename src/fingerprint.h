/**
 * A Fingerprint is information about a file that Shuriken stores in the
 * invocation log. It contains information that can be used to detect if the
 * file has been modified (or started or ceased existing) since the Fingerprint
 * was last taken. This is the basis of what Shuriken uses to find out if a
 * build step has become dirty and needs to be re-invoked.
 *
 * Unlike Ninja, which only uses file timestamps, Shuriken uses (a hash of) the
 * contents of the file to do dirtiness checking. The reason Shuriken does not
 * rely only on timestamps is the same as most of the other changes compared to
 * Ninja: It is possible for builds to do the wrong thing when using only
 * timestamps. This can happen if a file is modified within the same second as
 * the build of it finished. Then Ninja will not see that the file has changed.
 *
 * The algorithm that Shuriken uses is inspired by the one used by git:
 * https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/racy-git.txt
 *
 * When performing a no-op build, this algorithm allows Shuriken to usually not
 * have to do more than stat-ing inputs and outputs before it can decide that
 * nothing has to be done.
